    <h2>PLOT</h2>
    <p>
        Jaison, a young tailor from the village of Kurukkanmoola, dreams of building a career in the United States.
        Sub-Inspector of police Saajan forbids Jaison to date his daughter Bincy, with who Jaison is in a relationship with, and
        tells him that she is already engaged to Aneesh. Aneesh's ex-girlfriend "Bruce Lee" Biji is also angry that Aneesh had
        broken up with her. Meanwhile, Shibu is a social outcast who works in a teashop. Shibu is obsessed with Usha, the sister
        of Daasan who works in Jaison's father's tailor shop, to the point of stalking her regularly.
        
        Usha has a daughter, who needs an urgent medical operation but Usha does not have the money to pay for the operation. On
        Christmas Eve, a lightning bolt simultaneously strikes Jaison, who is arguing with Saajan, and Shibu, who is stalking
        Usha. Jaison is rushed to the hospital, where doctor Sambhashivan treats him, but to everyone's surprise, he is
        seemingly unharmed.
        
        In the following days, Jaison and Shibu show signs of superpowers. Jaison's nephew, Josemon, comes to the conclusion
        that Jaison gained superpowers after being hit by the lightning. One day, Jaison's brother-in-law Constable Siby Pothan
        gets into a fight with his wife because she gave her jewelry to jaison for applying for visa of U.S. Enraged by this,
        Jaison pushes Pothan and the latter falls into a well and everyone present is shocked by his strength. Usha comes to
        Shibu's teashop where the owner makes a move on Usha. Shibu is enraged and threatens him with his new telekinetic
        powers, asking him to stay away from her. Meanwhile, Jaison's plans to go to the United States come to an unexpected
        halt after his passport verification doesn't go through after Saajan meddles with it.
        
        Saajan reveals that Varkey is not Jaison's real father. Jaison's real father is Martin, an actor who died while Jaison
        was young when the set of the village play caught fire. Varkey saw the young Jaison and felt pity for him, raising
        Jaison as his own son. In the present, Jaison is heartbroken after hearing the news. Varkey tells Jaison that he didn't
        reveal the truth earlier as he feared that Jaison would abandon him and told him that his father helped everyone in the
        village and died for the sake of village. Jaison realizes that Saajan had hit Varkey. Jaison is enraged and with the
        help of Josemon, disguises himself with a mask and goes to Josemon's school's anniversary where many policemen,
        including Saajan, are present as the security for chief gust at function.
        
        Jaison, wearing the costume, attacks the policemen. He writes the name Minnal Murali on the front curtain of the stage
        the anniversary event was held, named after a character in Martin's unfinished play. Meanwhile, Usha's daughter faints
        and is taken to the hospital. The doctor tells Usha that her daughter needs to start the operation on her now or else
        she might die. Shibu arrives and tells the doctor that he will pay for the operation. To acquire the money, Shibu also
        wears a mask and robs the local bank as Jaison attacks the policemen, pinning this incident on 'Minnal Murali'.
        
        When Shibu gives the money to the hospital, the doctor tells that Daasan had already paid for it. Meanwhile, Pothan
        finds out that Jaison is 'Minnal Murali', but Saajan does not believe him. Jaison had been saving money that was given
        by his sister for applying for visa, keeping it in his tailor shop, but it has disappeared the same day. Jaison realizes
        that Daasan had stolen the money for the operation. Jaison aggressively confronts Daasan and gives him a deadline to
        give him the money back before that evening. Meanwhile, Usha slowly warms up to Shibu but Daasan rejects him. Jaison
        realizes his mistake and goes to Daasan to apologize. Shibu comes to Jaison's store and accused Daasan of being the
        obstacle between his and Usha's relationship. Shibu burns down the store, killing Daasan, and then once again blames
        'Minnal Murali' for the crime.
        
        Jaison reveals to Biji that he is 'Minnal Murali'. Biji and Josemon decide to help Jaison prove to the villagers that he
        is not the one who robbed the bank and killed Daasan while also finding the imposter. The police and Jaison view footage
        of the store, the night Daasan died, at the police station to see the identity of 'Minnal Murali,' but the power goes
        out the exact moment they are about to find Shibu. Shibu, wearing a mask, ambushes the police station in an attempt to
        destroy the video record, the only evidence to show that he is the impostor, but Jaison as 'Minnal Murali' attacks him
        and steals the Video Cassette. Jaison and Shibu take their fight to a bus, where Shibu bests Jaison due to him having
        telekinesis, which Jaison does not have. Shibu destroys the cassette and escapes. However, in the altercation, the bus
        driver hits his head and dies, which leads to the bus not stopping before reaching the edge of a cliff, dangling
        precariously off of it, but Jaison saves the bus, which gains him a few villagers' respect. Jaison and Shibu start
        investigating and they find out each other's identity.
        
        Saajan and the police force arrive to arrest Shibu as they found out that Shibu is the impersonator but Shibu scares
        them away. Pothan finds a picture with 'Minnal Murali' in it and shows it to Saajan. Saajan believes Pothan's findings
        and arrests Jaison. Usha comes to Shibu's house and realizes Shibu's love for her and reciprocates it. Shibu sees a mob
        outside his home and tries to stop them, but unknown to Shibu, his house slowly catches on fire. A barrel full of
        firecrackers catch fire, causing his house to explode, killing Usha and her daughter and injuring Shibu. A
        grief-stricken and now-psychotic Shibu, goes to a church and kills many people while trapping many others, including
        Josemon, planning to burn them alive for revenge. The police is alerted about the situation, and Saajan leaves Jaison as
        he realizes that Jaison is the only one who can stop Shibu. Jaison wears a supersuit, goes to the church, and confronts
        Shibu. Jaison succumbs to Shibu's telekinesis once again, but Jaison has second wind after remembering his father and
        his sacrifice for the village and villagers, awakening his own telekinesis powers.
        
        Jaison and Shibu clash again, ending in Jaison impaling Shibu with a prop spear, killing Shibu instantly. While saddened
        over his death, Jaison finally gets appreciation from the villagers while Biji puts out the fire. The film ends with
        Jaison telling the audience that many more villains will come in the future, but 'Minnal Murali' will be there to
        protect the villagers.
